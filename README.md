Guy-Manuel-Helmet
=================

Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo (half of Daft Punk) helmet controlled via Arduino

*STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS*

Large chunks of code politely "borrowed" from https://github.com/adafruit/piccolo

Uses LedControl library (http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/LedControl)
as well as
ffft library (https://github.com/adafruit/piccolo/tree/master/ffft)

As I am currently focused on the hardware aspect of this project, once I move over to the software side I plan on using a Fast Hartley Transform algorithm to process audio frequencies more productively.
